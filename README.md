*******************************Spam Detection using Naive Bayes***************************

Overview
This project implements a Spam Detection System using the Naive Bayes algorithm. The model classifies emails or messages as either spam or not spam based on the frequency of certain words or features. The dataset contains labeled messages, and the model uses the Naive Bayes algorithm to learn from these labels and predict the spam likelihood for new messages.

Features
Implements Naive Bayes classifier for binary classification (spam or not spam).
Supports text preprocessing like tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming.
Uses TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction.
Evaluates performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

Python 3.6+
The following Python libraries installed:
scikit-learn
pandas
numpy
nltk
Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy: 96.79% - The model correctly classifies messages as spam or not spam with high precision.
Precision: Measures the proportion of correctly identified spam messages.
Recall: Measures the ability to detect all spam messages.
F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.

Conclusion
The Naive Bayes-based spam detection model achieved an accuracy of 96.79%, demonstrating its effectiveness in distinguishing between spam and non-spam messages. The simplicity and efficiency of the Naive Bayes algorithm make it an excellent choice for text classification tasks such as spam detection. Despite its strong performance, future improvements could include experimenting with more advanced models like Support Vector Machines (SVM) or deep learning techniques, fine-tuning hyperparameters, and working with larger, more diverse datasets. Overall, this project showcases how classic machine learning algorithms can perform remarkably well in real-world applications.
